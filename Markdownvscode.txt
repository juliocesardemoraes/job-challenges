VS Code supports Markdown files out of the box. You just start writing Markdown text, save the file with the .md extension and then you can toggle 
 visualization of the editor between the code and the preview of the Markdown file; obviously, you can also open an existing Markdown file and start working with i
 t. To switch between views, press Ctrl+Shift+V in the editor. You can view the preview side-by-side (Ctrl+K V) with the file you are editing and see changes reflected in real-time as you edit.
